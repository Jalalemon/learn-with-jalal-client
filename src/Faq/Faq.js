          <h5>REACT</h5>
          <p>
            React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for
            building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by
            Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. The
            current logged in user (authUser) is retrieved from Redux state with
            a call to the useSelector() hook. Redux is used in this example
            however it is not required to implement a Private Route component in
            React Router 6. You could use a different state management library
            or any approach you prefer to get the logged in status of the user.

            Bootstrap 5 is evolving with each release to better utilize CSS
            variables for global theme styles, individual components, and even
            utilities. We provide dozens of variables for colors, font styles,
            and more at a :root level for use anywhere. On components and
            utilities, CSS variables are scoped to the relevant class and can
            easily be modified.
